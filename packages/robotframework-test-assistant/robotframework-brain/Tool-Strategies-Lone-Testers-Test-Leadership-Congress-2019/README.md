# Test tool strategies for lone testers - Test Leadership Congress 2019 Presentation

## General Information

This [repo](https://github.com/jg8481/Tool-Strategies-Lone-Testers-Test-Leadership-Congress-2019) contains all of the examples that will be covered in the "Test tool strategies for lone testers" presentation. More information about this Test Leadership Congress 2019 presentation can be found here... https://testleadershipcongress2019.sched.com/event/O5Zg/test-tool-strategies-for-lone-testers

The following are the basic technical requirements to run the examples during the presentation.
- Docker CE
  - OSX: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install
  - Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install
  - Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu

- Docker Compose
  - OSX: Included in Docker CE
  - Windows: Included in Docker CE
  - Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

The following are optional requirements that you can install on your machine. They will be explained in the presentation and demonstrations.

- cURL -> https://curl.haxx.se
- yEd Graph Editor -> https://www.yworks.com/products/yed
- a Slack account (preferably one under your control)
- RobotFramework-Metrics -> https://github.com/adiralashiva8/robotframework-metrics
- Charles Proxy -> https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/proxying
- Appium Desktop -> https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop

Here is a brief summary of some of the tools used in this presentation.

- Dockerized parallel and serial randomized tests, with results merging using Robot Framework.
- Options for generating randomized test data using builtin keywords or malformed test data with the well known Radamsa general purpose fuzzing tool, https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa
- Several examples of Slack notification keywords using a hybrid-manual-automated approach and Dockerized tests
- Robot Framework + Graphwalker (a model-based testing tool) examples with replayable test runs while running a slow internet connection proxy called "Crapify", https://github.com/bcoe/crapify
- Webhook mechanism that can trigger remote test processes with cURL commands, https://github.com/adnanh/webhook
- Dashboard of Session-based Test Management using Shiva Prasad Adirala's excellent RobotFramework-Metrics project, https://github.com/adiralashiva8/robotframework-metrics

The examples in the presentation use a lot of Shell scripting. If you have a Windows operating system, the following options may work for you.
- Consider downloading Git for Windows -> https://git-scm.com/download/win and https://gitforwindows.org
- Windows 10 users may already have Bash -> http://techgenix.com/bash-on-windows-10
- Since you will probably already have docker-compose installed you can copy the commands and run them individually.

Before the presentation, please run the following on your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/jg8481/Tool-Strategies-Lone-Testers-Test-Leadership-Congress-2019.git
cd ./Tool-Strategies-Lone-Testers-Test-Leadership-Congress-2019
```
Set up `.env` and `local.env` files using the provided `template.env` and `template.local.env` files. After setting up your `.env` and `local.env` files you can run the following, but it will require Docker on your machine.
```
./start-specific-docker-example-workflows-for-workshop.sh Build-Images-Teardown-Old-Docker-Containers
```
